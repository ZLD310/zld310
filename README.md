This is a counter-intuitive era. Lovers were separated, justice was killed, and even the feeling of painfulness was such a luxury: everything in this toxic atmosphere is so desperate. Someone said that's a world that god has forgotten, and someone said romance has extinct here. However, even though, we, those naive curbs, are still seeking romanticism in the debris after the catastrophe. 

I definitely found something, like this list of songs. They were hidden in the corners of this lonely universe, where busy people can never see. But once meet, it will be forever. Every time I went in, I would have a feeling of peacefulness, like the fetus in the womb.

And now, my pretty little girl, I'd like to share that with you, as a small present. I want to meet you in this fantasy, just like what I'm eagerly expecting in every piece of our life.

And here we go. Let's put on our headphones, and start our private journey.

### Chapter 0: Start from the Cath√©drale

The opening number in *Notre Dame de Paris*, the first musical I watched (on my cellphone). Nothing will be better than that as the beginning of our list. It will remind me that there are still stars in the night sky, and we are still god's daughter and son. Whatever how worse that world is, as long as there are still poets singing, it will be worthy living with dreams and hope.

### Chapter 1: Down the rabbit hole: Fairy stories

The rabbit hole is where Alice entered the wonderland, and it is also the name of the first chapter in *Wonderful Everyday ~Diskontinuierliches Dasein~*, one of my favorite galgame (kind of visual novels). In that story, a gang of students used their way to touch "the borderline of the sky", which ended in suicides with religious implications. Such a description seems like a pure tragedy, but once you step into their world, you would stop thinking about life and death: people who killed themselves could impress us and stay in our memory forever, while other normal and dull people just "literally" keep living in narration. So who lives longer? What's the definition? If we write down all the stories happened in their life, who would have a heaver book?

I love stories because they can eliminate all the nonsense happening in our life and just leave the compressed version. Thus, in this chapter, I picked songs that have their own story. I will not enumerate the stories here, partially because I'm lazy and partially because I want to leave them as a hook (For luring you!). And in the next chapter, we will go to another level of the story: the story about story writers.

### Chapter 2: Idol! Sound of echo

I used to believe that the best writer or music composers should be hidden behind their masterpieces until they were buried and forgotten. That's true in some cases, but what I gradually learned is that we can never deny that there is such a category of music: People choose to memorize them, not only because of themselves but also because of the soul who created that. Thus, in this chapter, I selected some very personalized compositions here. While in the first chapter, light music dominated, there we would meet with different types of music. Wish you would like them.

### Chapter 3: Break! Schnuffel time!

While I'm always a gloomy person, I really want to be a kid once more. Here, I'm going to share some kid songs with you! Wish you like Schnuffel's Bunny Paradise!

### Chapter 4: Silence: Where old memories wake up

When night came, nightmare followed. Just like primitives depend on file to chase out beasts, a kid used to rely on them for a sound sleep. Every time he put the headphone on, he could see the forest, moon, wind, sea, and stars. In the peacefulness created by music, our little child could have a short dream after fighting with dread illusion. Here, I choose to share the representative musics he listened to you, and wish you could touch the feeling he used to experience here.

### Chapter 5: FIGNT against light! Marry the NIGHT!

A time to love and a time to hate, a time to be quiet and a time to curse our fate! Let's stand up at this chapter and just be a bit noisy!

### Chapter 6: Mountains May Depart

<iframe frameborder="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="100%" height="100" src="https://music.163.com/outchain/player?type=2&amp;id=27198266&amp;auto=1&amp;height=100"></iframe>

After all of the songs here, we are approaching the end of our journey. Just like what is described in the movie, all the people we meet in our life might just pass by, and every era would have its own limitation. We have no idea about how the world will be, and I also can't predict how long would we be on the same trail. Maybe one day we will run in the opposite way, and maybe one day we will meet again. All I wish is that I can be a wind in your world, visiting everywhere but taking nothing from you. If we are lucky enough, please let us meet again where flowers flourish.

### Chapter 7: End in Spring: Where elves sing

<iframe frameborder="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="100%" height="100" src="https://music.163.com/outchain/player?type=2&amp;id=683826&amp;auto=1&amp;height=100"></iframe>  
<br>

That is the final chapter in our journey! Although its a winter birthday, I wish we can have one more celebration in late Spring next year. The word "hope" is such a luxury these days, but I still want to thank god for giving that to us.

Wish in your life, the water would never froze.

Wish in your life, sun and moon would always company with you.

Wish in your life, desperation would be only in the past, and love would be given to you.

And one more selfish blessing: Wish in your life, I will be there with you.

Happy birthday. My little girl. 

May your day be blessed.

*Light*<br>
*Forever*
