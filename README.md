This is a counter-intuitive era. Lovers were separated, justice was killed, and even the feeling of painfulness was such a luxury: everything in this toxic atmosphere is so desperate.

Whatever how worse that world is, as long as there are still poets singing, it will be worthy to live with dream and hope.
