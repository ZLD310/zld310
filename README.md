This is a counter-intuitive era. Lovers were separated, justice was killed, and even the feeling of painfulness was such a luxury: everything in this toxic atmosphere is so desperate. Someone said that's a world that god has forgotten, and someone said romance has extinct here. However, even though, we, those naive curbs, are still seeking romanticism in the debris after the catastrophe.
I definitely found something, like this list of songs. They were hidden in the corners of this lonely universe, where busy people can never see. But once meet, it will be forever. Every time I went in, I would have a feeling of peacefulness, like the fetus in the womb.
And now, my pretty little girl, I'd like to share that with you, as a small present. I want to meet you in this fantasy, just like what I'm eagerly expecting in every piece of our life.
And here we go. Let's put on our headphone, and start our private journey.
