This is a counter-intuitive era. Lovers were separated, justice was killed, and even the feeling of painfulness was such a luxury: everything in this toxic atmosphere is so desperate. Someone said that's a world that god has forgotten, and someone said romance has extinct here. However, even though, we, those naive curbs, are still seeking romanticism in the debris after the catastrophe. 

I definitely found something, like this list of songs. They were hidden in the corners of this lonely universe, where busy people can never see. But once meet, it will be forever. Every time I went in, I would have a feeling of peacefulness, like the fetus in the womb.

And now, my pretty little girl, I'd like to share that with you, as a small present. I want to meet you in this fantasy, just like what I'm eagerly expecting in every piece of our life.

And here we go. Let's put on our headphone, and start our private journey.

### Chapter 0: Start from the Cath√©drale

The opening number in *Notre-Dame de Paris*, the first musical I watched (on cellphone). Nothing will be better than that as the beginning of our list. It will remind me that there are still stars in the nightsky, and we are still god's daughter and son. Whatever how worse that world is, as long as there are still poets singing, it will be worthy to live with dream and hope.

### Chapter 1: Down the rabbit hole: Fairy stories

Rabbit hole is where Alice entered the wonderland, and it is also the name of the first chapter in *Wonderful Everyday ~Diskontinuierliches Dasein~*, one of my favorate galgame (kind like visual novel). In that story, a gang of students used their own way to touch "the borderline of the sky", which ended in suicides with religious implications. Such description seems like a pure tragety, but once you really step into their world, you would stop thinking about life and death: people who killed themselves could impress us and stay in our memory forever, while other normal and dull people just "literally" keeps living in narration. So who actually lives longer? What's the definition? If we write down all the stories happened in their life, who would have a heaver book?
I love story, because it can eliminate all the nonsenses happening in our life and just left the compressed version. Thus, in this chapter, I picked songs that have their own story. I will not enumerate the stories here, partially becasue I'm lazy and partially because I want to leave them as a hook (For luring you!). And in next chapter, we will go to another level of the story: the story about story writers.
